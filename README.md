Calendar Group Import Automation (PowerShell)

Overview
This PowerShell script automates the import, preview, and safe update/creation of calendar events in a Microsoft 365 Group calendar using Microsoft Graph. It validates a source CSV, detects duplicates, and supports dry-run/preview mode for safe and idempotent operation.

Features
CSV Schema Checks: Verifies existence and required headers of calendar CSV input.
Duplicate Detection: Finds duplicate events within the CSV by subject and date.
Preview Decisions: Calculates per-row import decisions: WouldCreate, WouldUpdate, WouldSkip, DuplicateInCsv, or Invalid.
Interactive Microsoft Graph Connection: Handles delegated authentication for required permissions (Group.ReadWrite.All).
Group & Calendar Resolution: Looks up the target group and its primary calendar (sample: calendar@domain.com).
Safe Event Creation & Update: Only creates or updates events as decided by the preview logic; supports -WhatIf mode.
Logging: Exports detailed preview and run summaries to timestamped CSV logs.
Verbose Option: Additional runtime diagnostics for troubleshooting.

How It Works
Validate CSV using Test-CalendarCsvSchema
Detect Duplicates and preview import actions with Get-CalendarMatchPreview
Connect to Microsoft Graph using Connect-CalendarGraph
Resolve Target Group and Calendar with Resolve-GroupCalendar
Dry-run or Live Import with Invoke-CalendarImport (-WhatIf recommended initially)

Example Usage
powershell
# Dry run: preview import actions, no changes made
Invoke-CalendarImport -WhatIf -Verbose

# Live run: creates/updates group calendar events
Invoke-CalendarImport -Verbose

Prerequisites
PowerShell 7.x recommended
Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK (install with Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser)

Configuration
